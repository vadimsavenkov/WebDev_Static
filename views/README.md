## Process

The original design started from identifying the information displayed on the index.html using HTML. The idea was to create a basic home page with header, hero section and responsive navigation.

In the header section, I included the website logo as well as navigation tab. I have dicided to locate my navigation panel in the middile of the header instead of following a common practice to place it on the right side of the page header. For each tab in navigation bar I have used icons from Fontawesome. 
 
I have used a main element to locate a title, hero section image and signup bar. In order wrap the elements of the hero section a simple div was used for separation and adjustment in the middle of the page.The same approach was used to create login and registration page. Primary navigation was highlighting rthe current page if on Register or Login.
 
While the HTML part was relatively straightforward, the CSS part was quit challenging, especially while building login and Register pages.
Some links were quite helpful to find the right combination of adjusting parameters to center the elements of the containers.

In order to highlight some elements I was using background images istead of background colors. All the pictures were taken from Lorem Picsum.
All the changes and tweaks were done using https://codepen.io/dashboard/ then cleaned and adjusted using VSCode.

In order to make static website more responsive I have added JavaScript elements to the original design.That allowed to create image gallery section using forEach loop without using any local images. The gallery takes images from Lorem Picsum through the loop and locate the right items in the object.
